# TV-Head-Project
TV-Head electronics project originally inspired by [Vivian's TV head](https://rose.systems/tv_head/), but taken further by the addition of a few interesting modules and, of course, entirely coded by myself.


This project serves three purposes. Firstly, and the more "societaly important" one is for my academic success. I am using this project as my end-of-program research topic for my TIM DEC. Secondly, the "fun" reason, is for my cosplays. Not only am I learning a ton by messing around with different electronics, but I'm having a blast by making things even as simple as an OV2640 camera work. It'll help me greatly expand my list of skills and add a string to my bow when it comes to cosplaying techniques. Bonus point for making me one of the only (or at least as far as I've seen) cosplayer originating from Québec to use electronics with such a degree of complexity, and I am happy to share my progress on GitHub for all aspiring cosplayers to learn from (WE NEED MORE WORKING TV HEADS IN CONVENTIONS!!). The third purpose is, of course, to share my progress as I have just said. I'd love to see more electronics being used in conventions, or at least more than simple LEDs animations, but I understand that it is not something easy to do. You need to learn a lot of different skills from coding to soldering, and those take time, money, and effort just to be able to do something usable. 

The fourth secret purpose is to be able to eventually do the electronics parts of my partner's cosplays... might as well make those newly acquired skills useful to others, no? 

Everything is coded in half-english, half-french. Why? Tokébakicitte! I'm from Québec, and speak & write both in English and French. That includes my code. 

Oh, and side-note, I probably won't commit every little change to this repository. It might be irregularly scheduled big steps composed of a lot of different things. Since I started this project before actually having to do reports (for school), I'm commiting when I think about it, and that might not be as often as it could. I'll try to keep the code as commented as possible & the commit messages as useful as possible.

I don't use GitHub enough to know if there's a way to message people, but if you'd like to ask me your questions regarding the project, feel free to contact me on GitHub (if that's even possible) or via Instagram at @emile_litalien.
